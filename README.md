# SnakeEater
this is a Front-End Project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript that helps us relive the memory of the classic Snake and Ball Game we used to play in our childhood on keypad phones.
In this project, we play the awesome snake game with some excellent music in the background and also music on eating the ball, game over, and relocation of the ball. There is also added functionality of  score and high score in which the highscore is saved in the browser's local memory.
An interesting fact about this project is that the background music is AI-generated courtesy of Sounddraw.
this project is also my first experience with GitHub Copilot.
